## How to run the program

 - Folder to be in : CoinJar.Api 
 - On your command window : dotnet run

 ## Concepts and patterns used
 - I made use of DDD, which has the benefit of having all your logic sit
   in one place rather than scatted throughout your system.  
 - I also made use of CQRS, the repository pattern, and the Unit of Work.
